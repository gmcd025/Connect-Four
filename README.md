# Connect-Four
The game Connect Four, ready to play!

This is a game build with JavaScript where I have broken down several different components such as the board, tokens, players and the score and combined it to make the project. This required planning, working on different ways to execute functions and lots of finnesse to get right.

This is a two player board game where you need to connect four tokens in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

Move the tokens by using the left and right arrow keys.

Drop the token using the down arrow key.

Have fun!
